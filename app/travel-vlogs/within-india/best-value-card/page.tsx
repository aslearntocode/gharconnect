                When it comes to choosing the best value credit card in India, the key lies not just in the features of the card, but how you use it. From reward points and cashback to travel benefits and milestone bonuses, credit cards offer real value—if used strategically.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">One Size Doesn't Fit All: Choose Based on Your Spending Pattern</h2>
              <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-8">
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The best credit card for you depends largely on your lifestyle:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                  <li><strong>Frequent domestic traveller?</strong> Look for cards with free flight tickets, airport lounge access, and airline tie-ups.</li>
                  <li><strong>International traveller?</strong> Opt for cards with low forex markup fees and global lounge access.</li>
                  <li><strong>Daily spender?</strong> Cashback cards or cards with accelerated rewards on groceries, fuel, and online shopping are ideal.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">Value Comes from Meeting Spend Milestones</h2>
              <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-8">
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Many credit cards offer annual fee waivers, bonus reward points, and vouchers when you reach certain spend milestones (e.g. ₹1 lakh or ₹3 lakh annually). If you can align your monthly expenses with these thresholds, you unlock tremendous value without spending extra.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">Maximize Rewards Through Smart Redemption</h2>
              <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-8">
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  How you redeem your reward points can make a significant difference. For instance:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Redeeming 10,000 reward points for flight tickets via the issuer's travel portal might give you ₹5,000 in value.</li>
                  <li>The same points may be worth only ₹2,500 if converted to cashback.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  Always check the reward catalogue and choose high-value redemption options like flight bookings, gift vouchers, or premium merchandise over plain cashback.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">Limit Your Credit Cards to 2–3 for Optimal Value</h2>
              <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-8">
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Having too many credit cards can lead to missed offers and poor reward tracking. Ideally, keep 2 to 3 credit cards that:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Cover your major expense categories (e.g. travel, fuel, groceries)</li>
                  <li>Offer milestone-based rewards and fee waivers</li>
                  <li>Complement each other in terms of features</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  This ensures you can track spends better, redeem rewards efficiently, and maintain a healthy credit utilization ratio, boosting your credit score.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">Final Word: Best Value is Personal</h2>
              <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-8">
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  There's no single "best credit card" for everyone. The best value credit card in India is the one that fits your spending habits and financial goals. Use your cards wisely, pay your dues on time, and redeem points smartly—and you'll get far more than what you pay in fees.
