                How Do Banks and NBFCs Evaluate Loan Applicants?
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                When someone applies for a loan, they might think that having a good credit score from a credit bureau is enough to get approved. 
                While that's partly true, Banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) create their own internal scores to evaluate risk, and credit scores from bureaus are just one part of that. These lenders use complex systems (like machine learning models) to predict how risky a borrower might be. 
                Let's break down the main factors they consider in simpler terms.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">Key Assessment Factors</h2>
              <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-8">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-indigo-700">1. Income Profile</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  <li><strong>Income:</strong> How much does the borrower earn? This could be from a job or a business. If the bank doesn't know the exact income, it estimates it conservatively.</li>
                  <li><strong>Debt:</strong> How much money does the borrower already owe to other lenders? If they have many loans, it may hurt their chances.</li>
                  <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> What are their regular monthly expenses like rent or bills? This helps estimate their remaining residual income.</li>
                  <li><strong>Residual Income:</strong> After paying all bills and debts, how much money is left? More leftover income improves their chances.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-indigo-700">2. Employment</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  <li><strong>Job Stability:</strong> Where does the borrower work? Someone working at a large, stable company (like Infosys) is seen as less risky than someone at a small startup.</li>
                  <li><strong>Government Employees:</strong> People working for the government are often considered more stable than private-sector employees, which might improve their chances of approval.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-indigo-700">3. Credit History</h3>
                <div className="pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  <p className="mb-4"><strong>Existing Credit:</strong> Does the person have a credit history? If yes:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4">
                    <li><strong>Past Behavior:</strong> Have they missed payments or defaulted on any loans? Late or missed payments are a big red flag.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Use:</strong> Have they taken a lot of unsecured loans (like personal loans or credit cards)? Or secured loans (like home or car loans)? Too many unsecured loans can make them appear financially unstable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit History Length:</strong> The longer they've been managing credit responsibly, the better.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className="mt-4"><strong>New-To-Credit:</strong> If they have no credit history at all, they're considered "New-To-Credit." Banks may be more cautious, but NBFCs are often more flexible, offering secured credit cards or other ways to build a credit history.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-indigo-700">4. Loan Applications</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  <li><strong>Multiple Loan Applications:</strong> If a person applies for loans or credit cards with many different lenders in a short period (say, more than 3 in the last 6 months), it might signal that they're facing financial trouble, making them a riskier borrower.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-indigo-700">5. Loan Amount</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700">
                  <li><strong>Loan Size:</strong> How much money is the person asking for? If someone with a low income is applying for a large loan, they'll be seen as a higher risk.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">How Are Borrowers Categorized?</h2>
              <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-8">
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Lenders use a scoring system to categorize borrowers into risk bands. Based on where someone falls, they either get approved or denied. Here's a simplified version:
                </p>
                
                <div className="overflow-x-auto">

                        </tr>
                      ))}
                    </tbody>
                  </table>
                </div>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-6">
                  For example, if a lender has a rule that they can only take bad rate up to 4% then anyone in risk bands 8, 9, or 10 will be granted the loan. 
                  People in lower bands mostly will get declined, though sometimes lenders will reconsider applicants in the middle bands (6 or 7) if they provide more data or clarifications (like proof of income).
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  In short, while having a good credit score helps, a lot of other factors go into deciding whether or not you'll get a loan. 
                  Banks and NBFCs use a combination of your income, debts, job stability, credit history, and even the amount you're borrowing to figure out how risky you are. 
                  If you're looking to improve your chances, it's important to keep these factors in mind and manage your finances responsibly!
